## THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED

**The templates in this repo have been accepted upstream into OpenAPI Generator and this repo is no longer needed**

# Overview

This repository contains a set of mustache templates which are meant to work with [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). These
templates take the existing templates and adds vendor extensions to the OpenAPI spec to support arbitrary annotations on a class,
field, getter, and/or setter. For example, in an OpenAPI Specification where you define a Schema type:

```yaml
    Employee:
      type: object
      x-java-class-annotations:
        - "@javax.persistence.Entity"
        - |-
            @javax.persistence.Table(
              name = "employees",
              uniqueConstraints = {
                @javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {"email"})
              }
            )
      properties:
        email:
          description: The email address of the employee.
          type: string
          example: hgranger@redhat.com
          x-java-field-annotations:
            - "@javax.persistence.Id"
        name:
          description: Name of the employee.
          type: string
        role:
          description: "The role of the employee. For example, consultant, PM, TSM, etc."
          type: string
          example: Consultant
```

The `x-java-class-annotations` and the `x-java-field-annotations` would be integrated into the model for `Employee` so that it would be compatible with JPA.

## Extra Considerations
In many cases, a type definition which has another type embedded within it is as simple as:

```yaml
properties:
  skill:
    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Skill'
```

This approach **WILL NOT WORK** with this set of extensions. The reason is that OpenAPI delegates complete control to the referenced type and will not parse
any additional vendor extensions. You can overcome this as follows:

```yaml
properties:
  skill:
    type: object
    x-java-field-annotations:
    - "@javax.persistence.ManyToOne(targetEntity = Skill.class)"
    - "@javax.persistence.JoinColumn(name = \"skill_id\", insertable = false, updatable = false)"
    allOf:
      - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Skill'
```

By defining the `type` as `object` and using `allOf`, you achieve the same result, but OpenAPI will parse and use the vendor extensions

## Supported Extensions To OpenAPI

* `x-java-class-annotations`: Can be used on any Schema Type definition which is not just a reference to another type
  * ```yaml
    Employee:
      type: object
      x-java-class-annotations:
        - "@javax.persistence.Entity"
        - |-
            @javax.persistence.Table(
              name = "employees",
              uniqueConstraints = {
                @javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {"email"})
              }
            )
      properties:
    ```
  * `x-java-class-annotations`: Can be used on any property of a Schema Type which is not just a reference to another type
    ```yaml
      properties:
        email:
          description: The email address of the employee.
          type: string
          example: hgranger@redhat.com
          x-java-field-annotations:
            - "@javax.persistence.Id"
        skill:
          type: object
          x-java-field-annotations:
          - "@javax.persistence.ManyToOne(targetEntity = Skill.class)"
          - "@javax.persistence.JoinColumn(name = \"skill_id\", insertable = false, updatable = false)"
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Skill'
    ```
  * `x-java-getter-annotations`: Can be used on any property of a Schema Type which is not just a reference to another type
  * `x-java-setter-annotations`: Can be used on any property of a Schema Type which is not just a reference to another type
